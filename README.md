Aloha Shopping

Landing Page

### The purpose of this project

To display my skills with front end technologies such as:

* HTML

* Sass

* JavaScript (ES6)

* jQuery

* Gulp

The site is fully designed to be responsive.

### Instructions

In order to transpile the Javascript and Sass, you need to run the gulpfile using npm in the terminal.

The JavaScript shopping cart along with an API call will be added soon.

To open this project and set up your environment, download the zip and open it. Use the terminal to cd into the project and run gulp and then install all the dependencies.
